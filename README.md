# Rocket Usermanager

This is a simple Usermanager using a SQLite database via `diesel`
to store Users. \
You'll need to have `sqlite3` and its headers installed:

  * **OS X:** `brew install sqlite`
  * **Debian/Ubuntu:** `apt-get install libsqlite3-dev`
  * **Arch:** `pacman -S sqlite`

Start: `cargo run`
